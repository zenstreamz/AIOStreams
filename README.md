## Description

Combines streams from other addons into one and provides much greater customisation:

- Change the format of the resutls
- Filter all results by resolution, quality, visual tags, audio tags, encodes.
- Remove duplicate results, and prioritise specific services for a given file.
- Sort all results by quality, resolution, size, cached, visual tags, audio tags, encodes, seeders, service, language
- Prioritise or exclude specific languages
- Specify a minimum and/or maximum size
- Limiting to a specific number of results per resolution
- Proxy your streams with MediaFlow

You simply configure your options, add any API keys for any services you use, then enable whichever addons you want, and install.

The addon will scrape all results from all addons, apply your configuration, and give the results back to you in one go.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not install other addons that you have enabled through this addon. You will only cause unnecessary requests to the addon.
> I also do not recommend installing/enabling too many addons as they all scrape mostly the same sources.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

The addon has parsers for specific addons and can extract the relevant information.
It goes through each addon you selected and obtains the results with all the parsed information.

Once it has all the parsed information for each result, it can apply your configured sorting and filtering options.

### Why was this addon created?

I wanted to have a single addon that could scrape all the sources I wanted and apply my own custom filters and sorting options.
Many addons lack the ability to finely tune how you want your results to be sorted and filtered.

Being able to change the format of every result was also a big factor in creating this addon.
I preferred the format of my GDrive addon and wanted to use that format for all my results.
This makes it easier to parse the results and explain to less tech-savvy people how to pick the best result.

It also means you only have to install one addon instead of configuring multiple addons.

Furthermore, being able to apply a global filter and sort to all results means that you can get the best results from all sources displayed first,
rather than having to check each addon individually.

### What are the currently supported addons?

It currently supports:

- Torrentio
- MediaFusion
- Comet
- Torbox Addon
- Debridio
- Jackettio
- Peerflix
- DMM Cast
- Orion Stremio Addon
- Easynews
- Easynews+
- [Stremio GDrive](https://github.com/Viren070/stremio-gdrive-addon)
- Custom: You can input an addon URL and name and it will parse as much information as it can.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL can either be a URL to the manifest.json or the url without the manifest.json
> e.g. `https://torrentio.strem.fun/` or `https://torrentio.strem.fun/manifest.json`

### What are the supported formatters?

The addon can display your results in different formats. The formats available are:

- gdrive:
  Uses the format from this [Stremio GDrive](https://github.com/Viren070/stremio-gdrive-addon) addon

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d9c74ab-afde-41f9-ba94-eaf8904b580b)

- minimalistic-gdrive
  A modified version of the `gdrive` format where the filename is not shown. Emojis are used for languages, and seeders are not shown for cached results.

- torrentio:
  Uses the format from the Torrentio addon.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343dccb4-13c5-4b57-998a-82b763e9ebf9)

- torbox:
  Uses the format from the Torbox stremio addon.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f90ee2-e81d-4a56-9e64-8937fb7ab2bc)

### What is Stremio or How do I use this addon?

Read my [Stremio guide](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio).

## Usage

### Public Instance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Torrentio is disabled on the public instance! However, most users don't need Torrentio and MediaFusion also provides streams from Torrentio, so try the public instance first, you may not need to self-host. 

[ElfHosted](https://elfhosted.com/) have been kind enough to host a [community instance of AIOStreams](https://aiostreams.elfhosted.com/configure).

This community instance does have a ratelimit in place, but it is unlikely you will reach it. It also avoids the ratelimits of ElfHosted addons like Comet and MediaFusion as AIOStreams' requests to these addons are routed internally.
However, other non-ElfHosted addons may rate limit the community instance.


### Cloudflare Workers

This addon can be deployed as a [Cloudflare Worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> Cloudflare Workers cannot make requests to other Cloudflare Workers from the same account. If you have deployed the Stremio GDrive addon already on a Cloudflare account, the AIOStreams worker on the same account will not be able to fetch streams from your Stremio GDrive worker.

> [!WARNING]
> A Cloudflare Worker may get blocked by Torrentio. You may also encounter a build error, in which case you will have to edit the code slightly and lose the functionality of the `ADDON_PROXY` environment variable

There are 2 methods to do this. Method 2 requires you to have Git and Node.js installed, method 1 does not, and only requires a web browser and a Cloudflare account.

**Method 1**

1. Fork my GitHub repository.
2. Head to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages), signing up for an account if needed.
3. Click the `Create` button and call your worker `aiostreams`
4. Click `Continue to project` after it's done creating
5. Go to the `Settings` tab.
6. Scroll down to the `Build` section, and click `Connect` on the Git repository option.
   - Choose your GitHub account, and the repository you created earlier when forking my repository
   - Leave the branch as main
   - Build command:
        ```bash
        npm install | npm run build
        ```
   - Deploy command:
       ```bash
       npm run deploy:cloudflare-worker
       ```
7. Click `Connect`
8. Trigger a redeployment by editing the README file at your fork (you can just add a letter and click commit changes)
9. You can find the URL for your cloudflare worker by clicking `View version` at the `Deployments` tab under the `Active deployments` section

If you get an error about the `node:sqlite` module, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/issues/32#issuecomment-2602643959), editing the code at your forked GitHub repository. 

**Method 2**

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare Account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages)
2. Install Node.js (I would recommend using package managers e.g. fnm on Windows)
3. Install Git
5. Run the following commands:



```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams.git
cd AIOStreams
npm i
npm run build
npm run deploy:cloudflare-worker
```

If you get an error about the `node:sqlite` module, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/issues/32#issuecomment-2602643959)

#### Updating

**Method 1**

Go to your forked GitHub repository and click sync fork. This should trigger a deployment, if not follow the same steps above to redeploy.

**Method 2**

To update the addon, you can simply run the following commands to pull the latest changes, build the project, and deploy the worker.
This will update the worker with the latest changes, which may not be stable. In case, you get the build error about `node:sqlite` again, follow the instructions linked above again. 

```
git pull --rebase
npm run build
npm run deploy:cloudflare-worker
```

### ElfHosted (paid)

> [!NOTE] 
> Use the link below to support me, 33% of your AIOStreams subscription will go to me ❤️ 

AIOStreams is available as a [paid product on ElfHosted](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/aiostreams/elf/viren070/). This offers you a no-hassle experience where you can expect things to "just work". 

### Heroku (paid) 

> [!TIP]
> Heroku have a [student offer](https://www.heroku.com/github-students/) which gives you $13 worth of credit each month to spend for 24 months. 

To deploy AIOStreams on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), you can fork this repository, and create a new app on the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), using `GitHub` as the deployment method in the `Deploy` tab, and choosing the `Node.js` buildpack in the `Settings` tab. 

### VPS

A VPS (Virtual Private Server) can be used to host many applications, not just AIOStreams. 

You can use the Free tier on [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). You can also look at the following posts for some cheap providers: 

- https://lowendbox.com/blog/1-vps-1-usd-vps-per-month/
- https://lowendbox.com/blog/2-usd-vps-cheap-vps-under-2-month/

You need a domain, and you can set AIOStreams up on your VPS by installing Docker and then using a [docker compose file](#docker-compose). 

### Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is a quick and convenient way to run this. Official images are available at the [ghcr.io](https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams/pkgs/container/aiostreams) and [docker.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/viren070/aiostreams) registries

You can use the prebuilt images using one of the following commands:

**GitHub Container Registry**:
```
docker run -p 8080:3000 ghcr.io/viren070/aiostreams:latest
```
**Docker Hub**:
```
docker run -p 8080:3000 viren070/aiostreams:latest
```

If you would like to pass one of the [environment variables](CONFIGURING.md), you can provide the -e flag, e.g. to provide a SECRET_KEY (recommended, see [CONFIGURING.md](CONFIGURING.md) for how to generate a secret key.): 

```
docker run -p 8080:3000 -e SECRET_KEY=... viren070/aiostreams:latest
```


If you don't want to use a prebuilt image, or want to build from a commit that isn't tagged with a version yet, you can build the image yourself using the following commands: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Viren070/aiostreams.git
cd aiostreams
docker build -t aiostreams .
docker run -p 8080:3000 aiostreams
```

#### Docker Compose 

Have a look at this post which contains a docker compose file with MediaFlow Proxy, and AIOStreams configured with Warp (to get around Torrentio blocks on some VPSs):

### Other

This addon can be deployed using some free solutions, but these should not be considered permanent solutions and can stop working at any point.

### From source

You need Node.js and git installed. Node v22 and npm v10.9 were used in the development of this project. I can not guarantee earlier versions will work.

1. Clone the project and set it as the current directory
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams.git
   ```
   ```
   cd aiostreams
   ```
2. Install project dependencies
   ```
   npm i
   ```
3. Build project
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Run project
   ```
   npm run start:addon
   ```
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000/configure`

You can change the PORT environment variable to change the port that the addon will listen on.

## Configuring

If you would like an explanation on the configuration options at the /configure page, have a look at this [guide for aiostreams](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/aiostreams) that I made. 

Outside of the configuration page, the behaviour of this addon can also be changed with environment variables.  
Most users don't need to set any environment variables. However, if you do, the SECRET_KEY is the one you might want to configure. This key enables encrypted manifest URLs, which help protect your API keys.

With encryption, someone who has your manifest URL can't directly see your API keys. However, they can still install the addon using the encrypted URL. Once installed, they can view API keys within other addons' URLs that are contained within AIOStreams' responses, as most addons don’t encrypt their manifest URLs.

### Environment Variables

Please see [CONFIGURING](CONFIGURING.md) for all the environment variables you can set. 

Below, you can find how to set environment variables for the different methods of deployment.

### Cloudflare Workers

Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to set environment variables for this addon on a Cloudflare Worker. You will have to modify the code directly. You can look in `packages/utils/src/settings.ts` to change the default values.

### Local

You can set environment variables using a .env file in the root of the project.

```
ADDON_NAME=AIOStreams
ADDON_ID=aiostreams.viren070.com
PORT=3000
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
COMET_URL=https://comet.elfhosted.com/
...
```

## Development

1. Clone the project and set it as the current directory
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Viren070/AIOStreams.git
   ```
   ```
   cd aiostreams
   ```
2. Install project dependencies
   ```
   npm i
   ```

Now, you can run various aspects of the project in development.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of these commands require that you build the project beforehand. Changes in other packages do not reflect immediately as it needs to be compiled into JavaScript first.
> Run `npm run build` to build the project.

To start the addon in development mode, run the following command:

```
npm run start:addon:dev
```

To run the cloudflare worker in development mode, run the following command

```
npm run start:cloudflare-worker:dev
```

To run the frontend of the project, run the following command

```
npm run start:frontend:dev
```

### Deploying

To deploy your cloudflare worker, run the following command:

```
npm run deploy:cloudflare-worker
```
